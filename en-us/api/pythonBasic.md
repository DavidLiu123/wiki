# Built-in Functions

The Python interpreter has a number of functions and types built into it that are always available. They are listed here in alphabetical order. For more details, please refer to [Built-in Functions](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/functions.html) .

|           |               | Built-in Functions |                |            |

| abs()     | all()         | any()              | bin()          | callable() |
| chr()     | classmethod() | compile()          | delattr()      | dir()      |
| divmod()  | enumerate()   | eval()             | exec()         | filter()   |
| getattr() | globals()     | hasattr()          | hash()         | hex()      |
| id()      | input()       | isinstance()       | issubclass()   | iter()     |
| len()     | locals()      | map()              | max()          | min()      |
| next()    | oct()         | open()             | ord()          | pow()      |
| print()   | property()    | range()            | repr()         | reversed() |
| round()   | setattr()     | sorted()           | staticmothed() | sum()      |
| super()   | type()        | zip()              |                |            |



# Built-in Constants

A small number of constants live in the built-in namespace. They are listed in the following table. For more details, please refer to [Built-in Constants](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/constants.html) .

| Built-in Constants |                                                              |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| False              | The false value of the bool type                             |
| True               | The true value of the bool type                              |
| None               | The sole value of the type NoneType                          |
| \_\_debug\_\_      | This constant is true if Python was not started with an -O option |
| Ellipsis           | Special value used mostly in conjunction with extended slicing syntax for user-defined container data types. |
| NotImplemented     | Special value which should be returned by the binary special methods (e.g. __eq__**()**ï¼Œ__lt__**()** ,etc.) to indicate that the operation is not implemented with respect to the other type. |



# Built-in Types
